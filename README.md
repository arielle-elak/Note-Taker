## Description
With the Note Taker app, you can save notes with a few clicks. Just click on the white + in the top righthand corner to create a new note. Type in the title and text, then click the floppy drive icon to save it. 

Plans for future development: implement a delete function which will remove a note you no longer wish to keep.

This is my first project with a deployment on Heroku. Please see the deployed app link here:
